Welcome to my github profile. There isn't a lot to see here. That's because a lot of repositories are private.


Anyways, I have a github pages site. You can suggest for projects there. Because I'm running out of ideas.
Link to the page : haunter-123.github.io

So, I am pretty good at developing web applications, but only backend, because I am real bad at designing.
